NOUMENON is "the thing in itself" 

NOUMENON differentiates itself from PHENOMENON as an object of thought separated from the world of the senses. Approaching the NOUMENON is our goal. We are not philosophers. We are designers. Our intention is to distill the ineffable, to find the heart of an organization. Then we mold the clay, and give it form. 

FUNDAMENTAL design. PHENOMENAL results.
